client use GET method to send request to server
32 byte : passkey
20 byte : requested video file hash
32 byte : a random AES key
44 byte : reserved free space

total: 128 byte
encrypt with dwindow public key to a new 128byte encrypted message, then convert to hex string

so the GET request would be
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/request.php?010203xxxx...."


server:
request.php get the 256 length GET string, send it to my dll
dll do:
1. checks if it is 0-F
2. convert it to 128byte array
3. decrypt it with dwindow private key
4. retrive 3 part of sended message
5. check passkey in database.
7. find video key for the requested video
if any of the first 7 step fail, it returns a "ERROR"
else, return a "OK" followed by AES encrypted video file key. that is 34 byte.
