 NOTE: All samples use "common.h" file, which allows linking to either static or dynamic versions
 of J2K-codec and can select various LIB-files automatically based on compiler settings.
 
 To link statically you need to purchase the Static Linking addon first.
 Go to http://j2k-codec.com/order.html to do so.
