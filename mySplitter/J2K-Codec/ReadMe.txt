                Readme for J2K-Codec 2.2 (release)
              Copyright (c) 2004-2012 Alex Saveliev.
-------------------------------------------------------------------


 OVERVIEW
 --------

 J2K-Codec is a software component, which allows easy integration of
 the new image compression standard - JPEG2000 - into your applications.

 This package includes:

  1. j2k-codec.dll. This DLL must be placed into your application folder.

     Do not place it in any other folder. There are good reasons for that.
     As Jeff Cogswell summed it up in his "Designing Highly Useable Software":

      "Thus, as I just mentioned, if you're letting the system loader load
       your libraries for you, the only viable place to put them is in the
       same directory as the application."

  2. Documentation in CHM format ('doc' folder).
     If you can't view it, read this: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2021383

  3. All files required to call J2K-Codec functions from your programs.

  4. Examples of J2K-Codec usage ('samples' folder).
     In C, C++, C#, VB.NET and VisualBasic.

  5. A collection of JPEG2000 test images ('test_images' folder).
